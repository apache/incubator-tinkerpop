*Gremlin Symphony #40 in G Minor*

TinkerPop 3.3.0
---------------

*Release Date: NOT OFFICIALLY RELEASED YET*

Please see the link:https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/3.3.3/CHANGELOG.asciidoc#release-3-3-0[changelog] for a complete list of all the modifications that are part of this release.

Upgrading for Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SelectStep Defaults to Pop.last
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`SelectStep` and `SelectOneStep` (`select()`) are the only `Scoping` steps that default to `Pop.mixed` as their labeled path
selection criteria. All other steps, like `match()`, `where()` and `dedup()`, use `Pop.last`. In order to better enable optimizations
around total `Pop.last` traversals, the `select()`-steps now default to `Pop.last`. Most users will not notice a difference as
it is rare for repeated labels to be used in practice. However, formal backwards compatibility is possible as outlined below.

Assuming that `x` is not a `Pop` argument:

1. Change all `select(x,y,z)` calls to `selectV3d0(x,y,z)` calls.
2. Change all `select(x,y,z)`-step calls to `select(Pop.mixed,x,y,z)`.

If an explicit `Pop` argument is provided, then no changes are required.

OptionalStep and Side-Effects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `optional()`-step was previously implemented using `ChooseStep`. However, if the optional branch contained side-effects,
then unexpected behaviors can emerge. Thus, a potential backwards compatibility issue arises is side-effects were being
used in `optional()`. However, the behavior would be unpredictable so this backwards incompatibility is desirable.

See link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-1506[TINKERPOP-1506]
Gremlin Console Script Execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is no longer possible to run a script in execution mode in the Gremlin Console from the terminal without use of `-e`.
In other words, prior versions allowed:

[source,text]
bin/gremlin.sh gremlin.groovy

Such a command must now be written as:

[source,text]
bin/gremlin.sh -e gremlin.groovy

See: link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-1283[TINKERPOP-1283]

Deprecation Removal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following deprecated classes, methods or fields have been removed in this version:

* `gremlin-console`
** `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.console.Console(String)`
* `gremlin-groovy`
** `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.groovy.engine.ConcurrentBindings`
** `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.groovy.jsr223.GremlinGroovyScriptEngine(ImportCustomizerProvider)`
** `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.groovy.jsr223.GremlinGroovyScriptEngine#plugins()`
** `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.groovy.jsr223.ScriptExecutor`
** `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.groovy.jsr223.customizer.SandboxExtension`

Please see the javadoc deprecation notes or upgrade documentation specific to when the deprecation took place to
understand how to resolve this breaking change.

See: link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-1283[TINKERPOP-1283], link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-1420[TINKERPOP-1420],
link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-833[TINKERPOP-833], link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-1040[TINKERPOP-1040]

Upgrading for Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Graph Database Providers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Performance Tests
+++++++++++++++++

Performance tests based on `junit-benchmarks` have been removed from TinkerPop. Specifically, providers should be
concerned with breaking changes related to the removal of:

* `StructurePerformanceSuite`
* `ProcessPerformanceSuite`
* `GroovyEnvironmentPerformanceSuite`

Those graph providers who relied on these tests should simply remove them from their respective test suites.
